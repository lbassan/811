```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## Defaults for R chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, ## echo = TRUE means code will show
                      warning=FALSE, ## supress warnings and messages from R
                      message=FALSE,
                      fig.path='Figs/', ## where to save figures
                      fig.height = 3, ## default figure size (can differ in each chunk)
                      fig.width = 3)

## Add any R packages you require. 
## Here are some we will use in 811:
requires <- c("tidyverse", ## tidyverse includes dplyr and ggplot2
              "magrittr",
              "foreign",
              "readstata13",
              "here")

## Install any you don't have
to_install <- c(requires %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE)
install.packages(c(requires[to_install], "NA"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/" )

## Load all required R packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_minimal())
library(magrittr)
library(here)
```

##Potential Datasets:
<!-- All of these look like solid options! 
If you have speech texts and want to get started on basic text analysis, let's talk. 
One easy, fun exercise is to make word clouds comparing two groups: https://judgelord.github.io/text/examples 
However, to select a real analytic method, we need a question! :)
